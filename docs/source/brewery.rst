Fermenting
--------

The first step in making a drink is to ferment the raw ingredients.
1. Place cauldron over heat source and fill it with water
2. Add the ingredients by right clicking
3. Wait the set time in said by the recipe
4. Fill glass bottles with the fermented liquid

You can use a clock to see how long the fermentation has been going on.

Distilling
--------

Not all recipes require fermentation 
To ferment:
1. Place the bottles into a brewing stand
2. Place glowstone dust into the top of the brewing stand. This will not be used up

Ageing
--------

A barrel is needed for aging. 

**Minecraft Barrel** | 6 slots
