Tags go before your username in both chat and tab list.

Set Tag
--------

To set your tag, run ``/tags``
This will being up a gui if you have any tags. Each nametag has a unique name which is a tag you can use.
To apply it, simply just press on the tag (some versions of bedrock may require you to select it and move it to another inventory slot)

Remove tag
--------

To removr your tag, run ``/tags``
At the bottom you will see a player head, press that and your tag will be unselected.
(Once again some bedrock versions may have to move the head to another slot)

Change tag
--------

To change your tag, run ``/tags``
Then simply just select another tag like you did when selecting the tag!
Note: You must have 2 or more tags to do this
